# Adventure Works Report & Dashboard

A custom dashboard I created using Power BI! I used the Adventure Works dataset for this endeavor, a fictional company that sells bicycles, clothing, and accessories. 

In this report, you'll find a wide array of visuals, including bar charts, tables, and line graphs, which offer a granular view of Adventure Works' sales performance over time. I've also leveraged Power BI's advanced features such as slicers, DAX (Basics), and bookmarks, all the while establishing relationships between data tables to ensure a user-friendly experience. This allows viewers to not only dive deeper into the data but also customize their view to extract the precise information they seek.

The report is meticulously detailed, encompassing product-level information and customer-level insights, empowering the company to scrutinize specific product performance and delve into customer behavior patterns.

Lastly thank you Maven Analytics for such a great learning experience.
